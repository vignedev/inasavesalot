# inasavesalot

...name is still work in progress.

Basically, Ina saves quite a lot and it was most notable during her Breath of the Wild playthough. So naturally, given the EU timezone, I was watching Ina at 5 AM and the sudden motivation to do another project struck me.

A year ago? Two years ago? Dunno, time flies by quick, I made [`inadoki`](https://github.com/vignedev/inadoki), which monitored Ina's heart rate monitor during her Horror Week. That project was written in the same way like this one, at 5 AM with a ton of caffeine coursing through my blood veins. However, this project will differ a bit from the other one, most notably by using Python instead of Bash-ing my way through it.

## Usage

This project is specifically tailored to detect the BoTW saving dialog and it is quite simple. To use this, you basically run:

```console
$ python3 main.py 
```
